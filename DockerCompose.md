# Docker Compose 

Docker compose is a simple yet powerful tool that is used to defining and run multiple containers as a single service.
For example, suppose you have an application which requires Nginx as a web server and MySql as a database service. In this case by docker-compose, you can create one single file (docker-compose.yml ) which will create both the containers as a single service without starting each separately
